 Subclassing Notes
 -----------------
 
 It is possible to subclass a STRCaptureViewController. You would do this if you want to include custom UI elements that are not available in the stock UI. Of course, you will need to provide some code to customize the behavior of these non-standard elements. All of the UI updates occur in the following internal methods which you will need to override:
 
    -(void)syncRecordUI;
    -(void)syncSelectorUI;
    -(void)imageCaptureHandleUI;
 
 An overview of the methods to override:
 
 ###syncRecordUI
 
 Syncs the user interface to reflect recording status. This method is called when video recording has started and again when it has ended (independent of success). In this method, you should update any user interface elements that respond to a change in the status of the instance variable isRecording.
 
 First, you should check isRecording to determine the recording state of the player. Next, you should update UI elements as necessary. For example, start or end record button flashing, enable or disable record buttons or capture mode selectors, etc.

 Changes the mode so that the recorder captures either a video or an image.
 
 This method is used to switch the capture mode between video and image states. Usually this is called when the selector switch is changed on the capture view controller. If you want to change the capture state programmatically, you can use the custom setter setCaptureMode: to pass either STRCaptureModeVideo or STRCaptureModeImage. For example, after you instantiate an instance of the STRCaptureViewController class, before presenting it, you can change the capture mode so that it will be in either Video mode or Image mode when the user pulls it up.
